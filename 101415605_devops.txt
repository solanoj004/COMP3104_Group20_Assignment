Information about the COMP 3104 DevOps course.

1. Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, 
where automated tests run to detect problems early.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Automated processes ensure that code changes can be released to production at any time, 
enabling frequent and reliable deployments.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code 
and automation rather than through manual processes. 
Tools like Terraform and Ansible are commonly used for this.
